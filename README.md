# WeatherForecast

It will be a simple weather forecast app, I am currently working on that project.

The app uses two APIs.
One is for the geolocation of the device: https://ip-api.com/docs/api:json,
the other provides data about the weather in specified location: https://open-meteo.com/en/docs.

The goal is to create a simple user interface that will show basic information about weather in user's location.
